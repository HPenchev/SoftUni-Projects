Transactions are atomic operations that alter database only when all the operations in the transaction are completed.
In case the transaction gets interrupted, it keeps back up and returns the data to its original state. For example money 
transfer is a transaction - when money is withdrawn from someone's account it has to be received from the rescepient. 
Otherwise it will not be confirmed and the amount would be returned to the account of the sender.
