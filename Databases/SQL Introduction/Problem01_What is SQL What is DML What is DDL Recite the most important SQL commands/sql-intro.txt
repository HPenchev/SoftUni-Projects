SQL (Structured Query Language) is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a 
relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system 
(RDSMS). Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition 
language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema 
creation and modification, and data access control.

A data manipulation language (DML) is a family of syntax elements similar to a computer programming language used for 
selecting, inserting, deleting and updating data in a database. Performing read-only queries of data is sometimes also 
considered a component of DML. A popular data manipulation language is that of Structured Query Language (SQL), which is 
used to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database. Other forms of DML are those used by IMS/DLI, CODASYL 
databases, such as IDMS and others. Data manipulation language comprises the SQL data change statements, which modify 
stored data but not the schema or database objects.

A data definition language or data description language (DDL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language for 
defining data structures, especially database schemas. Many data description languages use a declarative syntax to define 
fields and data types. SQL, however, uses a collection of imperative verbs whose effect is to modify the schema of the 
database by adding, changing, or deleting definitions of tables or other objects.
